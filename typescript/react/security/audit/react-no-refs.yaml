    message: >-
      `ref` usage found. refs give direct DOM access and may create a possibility for XSS, 
      which could cause sensitive information such as user cookies
      to be retrieved by an attacker. 
      Instead, avoid direct DOM manipulation or 
      use DOMPurify to sanitize HTML before writing it into the page.
